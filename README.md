### Customer CRUD

The above folder structure represents a small application with a RESTful API that interacts with MongoDb database to persist Customer records and is supported by a UI application which consumes the RESTful API. 
In a nutshell the application will allow the user to perform the following actions either from the GUI or from any http client. 
	1.	List customers 
	2.	Create a new customer 
	3.	Update a customer 
	4.	Deletes a customer

The project is divided into 2 parts 
	1.	CustomerProj - This contains the server side code for the Spring RESTFul Api which connects to MongoDb database instance 
	2.	customerui - The UI for the CRUD operations is developed in React.js

## Getting Started

	I have segregated the UI and backend projects. Hence they need to be deployed separately.
	A bit about the UI 
		1.	I have used React.js components and specifically the 'create-react-app' module to bring up the framwork.
		2.	Have used ReactRouterDOM for navigation and dynamic routing.
		3.	Used axios as an interface with backend REST Api 
		4.	And used the 'validator' to create customized FormValidator for user input
		
	A bit about the REST API
		1.	I have used SpringBoot to develop REST API for all the CRUD operations. Imlpemented CRUDRespository from the Spring Mongodb API for interaction with database. 
		2.	Used javax.validation on for user input requests from UI and also validate data requests from HTTP clients like curl, postman.
		3.	Have added a bit of exception handling to filter out cryptic messages from stacktrace and provide user friendly messages to user Have implemented spring logging.
		4. 	Have applied the emailAddress of the customer as a unique identification of the Customer.
### Prerequisites

	The REST API application is currently configured to connect to MongoDb on localhost:27017/test. The details are in the application.properties.
	In order for the application to run we need to have a MongoDb instance running.

### Installing REST

	To execute the REST API you would need to checkout the "CustomerProj" 
	Its a maven project. So you would need to install maven on your local and then build the project

```
	<yourpath>/CustomerProj>mvn clean package
```
	Once the build is complete you can run the project using Spring-boot run. Spring boot plugin has its own embedded tomcat. But i have used jetty in the pom.xml

```
	<yourpath>/CustomerProj>mvn spring-boot:run
```

	This should ideally run on http://localhost:8080/customers
	

## Running the tests for backend

	You can validate the REST API from command line curl tool.
	for e.g This will save a new Customer record using curl tool.
```
	curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d  "{ \"emailAddress\" : \"test@google.com\" ,\"lastName\":\"test\",\"firstName\":\"test\",\"address\":\"\"}" http://localhost:8080/customers
```
	This will give a list of all the customers
```
	curl http://localhost:8080/customers
```
```
	For Update
	curl -i -X PUT -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d  "{ \"emailAddress\" : \"test@google.com\" ,\"lastName\":\"Jon\",\"firstName\":\"Lee\",\"address\":\"\"}" http://localhost:8080/customers/test@google.com
```
### Installing UI
	The GUI application project resides in "customerui". This needs to be cloned in your local.
	I have removed the node modules folder. But it should pick up all the dependencies from the package.json
	Would require npm tool to start the GUI. Please use the following command to start the UI
		```
		<yourpath>/customerui>npm run start
		```
	It should ideally be deployed on http://localhost:3000. From here the navigation is pretty simple.


## Room for improvement
	Need to create a better readme file.
	Should have added User authentication. But then it will required entitlements management, session management, validation, 
	Should have added more junits and coverage.
	Good to have multithreaded support and connectioon pool for database.
	Currently the backend url is hardcoded in the UI application. It needs to be managed using runtime configuration.
